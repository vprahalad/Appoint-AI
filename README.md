# Appoint AI -- HackGT Project

Appoint AI is a medical appointment triaging system. It calculates medical urgency based on a self-description of patient symptoms; then, prioritizing the highest-urgency patients, Appoint AI schedules the earliest available appointment for each patient.

This repository contains 3 folders: data, backend, and frontend. This folder is the **data** folder.

**data**: the data folder contains all CSV files, including the data that was used to train the model and the data used to test the model.
