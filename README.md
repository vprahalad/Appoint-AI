# Appoint AI -- HackGT Project

Appoint AI is a medical appointment triaging system. It calculates medical urgency based on a self-description of patient symptoms; then, prioritizing the highest-urgency patients, Appoint AI schedules the earliest available appointment for each patient.

This repository contains 3 folders: data, backend, and frontend. This folder is the **frontend** folder.

**frontend**: the frontend folder contains the .py scripts that use Streamlit to display webpages, as well as the data necessary for those .py scripts to run.
