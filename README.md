# Appoint AI -- HackGT Project

Appoint AI is a medical appointment triaging system. It calculates medical urgency based on a self-description of patient symptoms; then, prioritizing the highest-urgency patients, Appoint AI schedules the earliest available appointment for each patient.

This repository contains 3 folders: data, backend, and frontend. This folder is the **backend** folder.

**backend**: the backend folder contains the scripts to perform sentiment analysis, collect patient input (utilized to create the UI), and create the scheduling algorithm.
